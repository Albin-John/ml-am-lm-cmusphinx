# How to utilize my test result to improve accuracy
In each speaker's folder, there is a set of 4 files.
Namely:
* ```test.fileids```
* ```test.transcripion```
* ```hyp-align-<speaker_name>.txt``` ( Final accuracy results )
* ```test.hyp```
of which the last two are generated files as per the [CMU Sphinx tuning documenaion](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialtuning)
